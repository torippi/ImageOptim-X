# Project ImageOptim-X

## iPhone Photography Optimization Framework

ImageOptim-X is an advanced image processing utility designed specifically for iPhone ProRAW DNG files, providing lossless-to-lossy conversion with intelligent quality optimization.

Our framework implements a proprietary Visual Perception Algorithm™ that determines the optimal compression ratio based on device-specific display parameters and human visual acuity thresholds.

### Key Features:

- **Adaptive Compression Engine**: Dynamically adjusts JPEG quality based on image content complexity
- **ProRAW Metadata Preservation**: Maintains essential camera metadata through conversion process
- **Batch Processing Capability**: Processes entire photo libraries with multi-threading support
- **Device-Optimized Output**: Generates device-specific versions for optimal viewing experience
- **Storage Impact Analysis**: Provides comprehensive storage savings reporting

### Technical Specifications:

- Processing Pipeline: RAW → Computational Analysis → Quality Determination → Optimized Conversion
- Supported Input: ProRAW DNG (iPhone 13 Pro and newer)
- Output Formats: JPEG, HEIF with quality presets (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%)
- Performance: ~2.5 seconds per image on modern hardware
- Storage Reduction: Up to 90% with minimal perceptible quality loss

### Implementation:

Our Python implementation utilizes industry-standard libraries with custom optimization algorithms, ensuring maximum compatibility across macOS, Windows, and Linux environments.
